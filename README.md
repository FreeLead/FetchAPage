Web Domain Scrapper

This is a basic web page scraper made in Python. It will scrape the page that you designate and any other pages on that domain as well as linked pages. All pages get their own .txt file. it has been designed to skip over mailto addresses for speed.
It also has error handling so it should not crash. All errors are put into a seperate file inside the folder for that domain for review. Enjoy and make any changes you need to.
